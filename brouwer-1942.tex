In my note, \emph{``Concerning the free development of spreads and
functions''},\footnoteT{Proc.\ Ned.\ Akad.\ v.\ Wetensch. Amsterdam,
\textbf{45}, 322 (1942).} the process $M_\sigma$ was considered, through which
the fundamental sequence $\digamma'$, which is enumerated in an arbitrary,
predetermined way, is associated one-to-one with finite choice sequences of
numbers and likewise an arbitrary element $\sigma$ of the spread\footnoteT{For
the sake of simplicity, we restrict ourselves in this note to such spreads, in
the process of whose creation neither inhibition nor termination occurs. This
restriction is inessential.} $M$. We want to call this process $M_\sigma$ a
spread \emph{of second order}, and the successions of figure-sequences thus
associated to the unrestricted choice sequences of numbers \EdMark{[we shall
call]} \emph{the elements of the second-order spread $M_\sigma$}.

The assertion stated in my quoted note, that $M_\sigma$ acts as a subspecies of
a spread $M_1$ which is derivable from $M$, and that the union of all
$M_\sigma$ generated from $M$ is identical with this $M_1$, shall be
demonstrated as follows. First, we will deal with the construction of the
spread $M_1$.
